This is a test project to play with GatsbyJS and NetlifyCMS (and Netlify deploying).

## Deployment

This project automatically deploys the master branch to Netlify when it is updated. That page is located [here](https://brave-mclean-849501.netlify.com).

## CMS

This project uses NetlifyCMS! Still trying to figure it out.
Configuring collections, pages, and fields is done in `/static/admin/config.yml`.

## CSS-in-JS

I'm using [Emotion](https://emotion.sh) to write CSS into each component.
